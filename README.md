BIP Wallet TESTNET is an application for buying, selling, and exchanging MNT—digital coin used in the Minter blockchain’s test network.

Featured on Telegram’s official blog, Minter has put a lot of effort into designing a fast, robust, and user-friendly mobile wallet.

Tired of having to memorize those long strings of symbols they call blockchain addresses? Quit that! With BIP wallet, you can transfer funds to an e-mail address and even a username. What’s more, it takes only five seconds for a transaction to be completed.
